# Why is this important?
#
# Erlang/ Elixir allows you to maximize all your threads
# by running concurrent threads. To note here is that this 
# is not a a processor thread but a thread in the Erlang VM.
# Erlang can run one or more schedulers that will divide your
# work across multiple processors.
