 # People talk a lot about Elixir's functional and concurrent nature.
 # What does that mean?
 #
 # Functional:
 # There is no shared state between functions. What you are doing is 
 # transforming data in a predictable way without side effects. Data is
 # therefore immutable unless it is re-assigned.
 #
 # Concurrent:
 # Short answer: Different things can happen at the same time. ex. Ruby
 # webservers vs. Erlang webserver.
